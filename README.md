# Machine-Learning-High-Performance-Computing-3

This is the repository of my assignment submission to ['High Performance Computing for Machine Learning'](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall18/CSCI-GA.3033-022/) course at NYU in Fall 2018.


The questions are in lab3_Questions.pdf. You can find all the code for the program in the lab3.cu as per the naming convention defined in lab3_Questions.pdf. You can find the batchfile -> batch.s and Makefile as well.
